Indentation: Unlike many languages, 
Python uses indentation to indicate blocks of code. 
Stick to 4 spaces or a tab for indentation.

if True: 
    print("This line is indented.") # Correct indentation
   
Variable Naming: Use descriptive names for your variables
user_name = "John" # Good 
x = "John" # Bad

Whitespace: Use spaces around operators for readability
# Good 
total = 5 + 3 

# Bad 
total=5+3
